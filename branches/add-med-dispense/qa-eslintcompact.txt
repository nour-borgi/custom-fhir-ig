/github/workspace/fsh-generated/resources/MedicationDispense-EthMedicationDispenseExample.json: line 47, col 4, Warning - UCUM Codes that contain human readable annotations like {tbl} can be misleading (e.g. they are ignored when comparing units). Best Practice is not to depend on annotations in the UCUM code, so this usage should be checked (BUSINESSRULE)
